cp1404practicals-: This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 – Programming II at James Cook University.
It includes weekly practicals that demonstrate key programming concepts such as functions, files and exceptions, lists, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming in Python.

I am Paul Phan. I have been in Australia for almost 2 years. Although it is still difficult to study, I hope that with my efforts, studying will become easier.

# 3 main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in this subject.
-Meaningful names: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and constants to make code self-explanatory.  
-DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):Reuse code effectively through functions and loops instead of repeating logic.  
-Consistent formatting: Follow conventions such as proper indentation, spacing, and line length to improve readability and teamwork.  

## Proper links (linked names, not 'bare URLs') to the Programming Patterns page and the CP1404 Practicals instructions repo.
